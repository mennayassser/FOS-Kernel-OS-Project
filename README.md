# FOS Kernel project - Ain Shams University (Operating Systems Course)
A modular operating system kernel focused on building an OS Kernel with isolated, replaceable components to deeply understand the inner workings of the OS components; howcore OS subsystems work, interact and depend on one another.

The primary goal is learning through implementation: planning modules, incrementally developingthem, testing, and iterating to ensure all dependencies, memory boundaries and fault scenarios are appropriately handled

Memory management is a key focus of the project, including handling physical and virtual memories, address translation, and the role these mechanisms plsy in isolation and protection.

## Group Modules
	* Dynamic Allocator
		Dynamic block allocation and deallocation
	* Kernel Heap
		Dynamic page allocation, deallocation, and virtual-physical address conversions
	* Fault Handler I

## Individual Modules
	* User Heap
		Dynamic user-space memory management
	* CPU Scheduling 
		Round-Robin Scheduling Algorithm
	* Shared Memory
	* Fault Handler II
	* Fault Handler III
	* Kernel Protection
		Memory isolation and protection mechanisms
	
## Core Principles
	* Modularity & Replacability
	* Incremental Development
	* Practical Learning

## Evaluation

- **Group Modules:** 100%
- **Individual Modules:** 100%
